#########OUTPUT#########
=== FOL Resolution Demo with Proof Tree ===
Enter number of clauses in Knowledge Base: 3
Enter clause 1: P v Q
Enter clause 2: ~Q v R
Enter clause 3: ~R
Enter query to prove: P

[Step 1] R1 = Resolve(C1, C4) → {'Q'}
[Step 2] R2 = Resolve(C1, C2) → {'P', 'R'}
[Step 3] R3 = Resolve(R1, C2) → {'R'}
[Step 4] R4 = Resolve(R3, C3) → {}

✅ Query is proved by resolution (empty clause found).
